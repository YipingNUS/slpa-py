ERROR: input network test.ipares not found!
GANXiSw 3.0.2(used to be SLPAw) is for weighted (directed) networks, version=3.0.2
Usage: java -jar GANXiSw.jar -i networkfile
Options:
  -i input network file
  -d output director (default: output)
  -L set to 1 to use only the largest connected component
  -t maximum iteration (default: 100)
  -run number of repetitions
  -r a specific threshold in [0,0.5]
  -ov set to 0 to perform disjoint detection
  -W treat the input as a weighted network, set 0 to ignore the weights(default 1)
  -Sym set to 1 to make the edges symmetric/bi-directional (default 0)
  -seed user specified seed for random generator
  -help to display usage info
 -----------------------------Advanced Parameters---------------------------------
  -v weighted version in {1,2,3}, default=3
  -Oov set to 1 to output overlapping file, default=0
  -Onc set to 1 to output <nodeID communityID> format, 2 to output <communityID nodeID> format
  -minC min community size threshold, default=2
  -maxC max community size threshold
  -ev embedded SLPAw's weighted version in {1,2,3}, default=1
  -loopfactor determine the num of loops for depomposing each large com, default=1.0
  -Ohis1 set to 1 to output histgram Level1
  -Ohis2 set to 1 to output histgram Level2

  -OMem1 set to 1 to output each node's memory content at Level 1
  -EC evolution cutoff, a real value > 1.0 
NOTE: 1. more parameters refer to Readme.pdf
      2. parameters are *CASE-SENSITIVE*, e.g., -Onc is not -onc
